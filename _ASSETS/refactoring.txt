Introduction:
=============
s. "Martin Fowler" - Refactoring has never been more important!

Refactoring Methods:
====================
- Descoping (enscoping?) ( Limit scope by intending into for-loop )
- From var to let ( from global to local )
- Separate multiple vars in one line var x, y = 10, z;
- Renaming ( clear speaking names )
- Introduce classes ( From {} to Sprite, Car etc. )
- Extract methods ( separate logical units )
- Add documentation ( where it adds value )
- Add typings (!) from JS to TS conversion
- Order variables, fields and methods by visibility, type (number, boolean, string, object, collections ) and static state.
- Group members by their logical corresponding
- Extract/Separate grouped members to new class
- Add const for non-changing values!
- Increase visibility ( private where possible! Then protected any finally public ) => create getters/setters for access control.

Tools that support:
===================
- Lint
- TS-Compiler
- IntelliJ
